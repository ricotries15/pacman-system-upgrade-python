# pacman-system-upgrade

Python script that checks if there are any recents [Arch Linux news](https://archlinux.org/news/) before performing an Arch Linux system upgrade.

This script is based on a previous Bash script I wrote ([pacman-system-upgrade](https://github.com/ricotries15/pacman-system-upgrade)) and it's part of my Python learning process.

### Use case

It is easy to forget to check for recent news before upgrading packages using `pacman`, so this script removes the possibility that a system upgrade will be performed in an Arch Linux device without taking in consideration any special steps or warnings announced by the maintainers/developers.

### Usage

TBD
